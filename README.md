# PyLinpack

This is a collection of scripts that implement the LINPACK benchmark in JAX.

They aren't writing the benchmark from scratch - instead coming at this from user space and leveraging
the libraries pulled in by jax, numpy, etc.

NOTE: I (Corey Adams) did not write this code, it is available here:
